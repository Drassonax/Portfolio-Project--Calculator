With the Calculator App, the user can compose mathematical expressions and get the final result back. The app supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The user can enter data into the calculator either by clicking on the buttons or by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard (number keys for numbers, operator keys for operators, '.' for a decimal point, 'Enter' for 'equals' and 'Escape' for 'clear'). If a complex expression is entered, the app will take the order of operations into account and perform mulitplication and division before addition and subtraction. When the user enters the equal sign, the entire expression is displayed along with the result. The user can then create a new expression by entering a number or continue calculating from the latest result by entering any operator sign. It is also possible to change the last operator by entering a new operator before entering a new number.
